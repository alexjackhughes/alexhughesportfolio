About a year ago I was very kindly invited to speak by MintBean to a bunch of junior devs about to break into the industry from across the planet.

I remember vividly how tough it is being a junior developer, and so I wanted to give honest advice that wasn't just pandering to get some cheap claps.

The result was this [talk](https://youtu.be/gYQiLGT_Yns).

Its not TEDx, but I hope you enjoy.
