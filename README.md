This is the repo for [my little slice of the internet 🍕](https://alexhughes.io).

It includes;

- 📄 A few pages about me
- 📬 Ability to subscribe to my newsletter
- 📝 My blog

### Getting Started

To run in development, use:

`npm run dev`

### Deploy

I deploy directly with Vercel, so that every time I make a commit a new build is launched to users within a few seconds.

### Tech Stack

For the curious, this is a TypeScript project built with Next and deployed on Vercel.

I'm using StaticKit for the forms and email subscriptions, and Bulma for the styling (with a bit of elbow greese from myself).
