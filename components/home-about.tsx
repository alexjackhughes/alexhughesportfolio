        My name is Alexander Jack Hughes. But you can call me Alex. I'm a
        full-stack engineer and builder of high-growth startups. To give you a
        quick history lesson; I've been coding for the better part of a decade,
        whilst achieving an MSc in Computer Science and writing a few things for
        Hackernoon. I can name drop if you'd like? Right now, I'm bringing
        transparency to your money at Tumelo. Before that, I was the 2nd dev
        hire at Huckletree (one of Europe's fastest growing workspaces) and
        designed the UI/UX for UpdraftPlus - which, with more than 3 million
        downloads is one of the most downloaded plugins on WordPress. But enough
        about me, how have you been?{" "}
